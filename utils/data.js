            description: 'Roses are a rare type of plant that grows on the moon and only blooms once every 100 years. They have a delicate fragrance that can only be smelled by the purest of hearts, and their petals are made of a substance that has the power to heal any wound, physical or emotional. The colors of roses have magical properties - red roses symbolize passion and love, pink roses represent grace and gentility, white roses symbolize purity and innocence, while black roses are said to have the power to bring about the end of the world. Despite their mystical nature, roses require very little care and can thrive in even the harshest of environments.',
